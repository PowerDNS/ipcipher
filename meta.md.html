ipcipher
========
`ipcipher` is a simple way to encrypt IPv4 and IPv6 addresses such
that any address encrypts to a valid address.  This enables existing tools
to be used on encrypted IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

The protocol is described [here](ipcipher.md.html).  

This page is about how and when to use the protocol, and what guarantees it
does and does not offer.

Applicability
=============
`ipcipher` is meant to be enable the analysis of traces, pcaps, logfiles etc
containing customer IP addresses, without revealing those actual (customer)
IP addresses.  Given privacy trends around the world and specifically the
advent of [EU GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/), it is more and more important
to protect personally identifying information. Worth nothing, the GDPR
touches specifically on how pseudonymization is part of [privacy by
design](https://iapp.org/news/a/top-10-operational-impacts-of-the-gdpr-part-8-pseudonymization/)
and how it can protect data if it leaks.

`ipcipher` is not in any way meant as an encryption algorithm that enables
the public dissemination of traces without impacting user privacy. It should
not be compared to, say, AES or Salsa20.

In other words, `ipcipher` encrypted IP addresses must still be protected.
This is because of inherent limitations of
'[pseudonymisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization)'. 

Limitations of pseudonimity
===========================

From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization):

> Pseudonymization is a procedure by which the most identifying fields
> within a data record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers,
> or pseudonyms.  (...) The purpose is to render the data record less
> identifying and therefore lower customer or patient objections to its use. 
> Data in this form is suitable for extensive analytics and processing.

Pseudonymous data can be analysed just like regular data. So for example, a
PCAP of a user-originated denial of service attack can be studied using
regular tools to identify the pseudonymous IP addresses performing the
attack.

These IP addresses can subsequently be decrypted to identify the actual
culprits.

If however the PCAP file contains more information, it may be possible to
deanonymize the encrypted IP addresses. For example, HTTP requests may
contain the actual user IP address as a referrer. This ties the encrypted
address to the original, and breaks pseudonimization.

Another famous example was the [AOL search data
leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak) in which AOL
released search queries for AOL user-ids, without revealing user names. It
rapidly proved possible however to identify specific users based on their
search traffic.

Chosen plaintext attack
=======================
Since there are only around 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses, if an attacker can
both determine what IP addresses appear in an `ipcipher` encrypted log, and
have access to that log, the algorithm fails at least for IPv4. This is
because the attacker can enumerate each and every IPv4 address to see how it
ends up in the log.

IPv6 is not suitable for enumeration, but a chosen plaintext attack could
still be used to verify a potential actual IP address candidate.

Suggested doctrine
==================
It is suggested that a new passphrase is used whenever new data is encrypted
for analysis.  This minimizes the opportunity for attackers to benefit from
previous re-identification efforts.

The procedure is then as follows:

 * Collect data to be analysed
 * Create a random passphrase, possibly using `pwgen`
 * Store passphrase securely
 * Encrypt IP addresses in trace/log/pcap
 * Send data off for analysis
 * If analysts have found interesting pseudonomyzed IP addresses, decrypt
    using stored key
 * Analysis team destroys encrypted trace data
 * Passphrase can be destroyed
 
Specific things to watch out for
================================
IP addresses should be encrypted wherever they appear in a trace or a log.
This is not always easy. Of specific note, ICMP messages may for example
contain another copy of the source or destination IP address of the packet.
So when encrypting PCAPs, make sure to drop any traffic known to contain
further copies of actual IP addresses that you aren't also encrypting.

Of specific note, tunnelled but unencrypted traffic (GRE, VXLAN, IPIP, SIT)
is guaranteed to carry further IP addresses 'inside'. 

It is advised to restrict PCAP captures to only the intended protocol (say,
DNS).

When encrypting text-based log files, be sure to encrypt not only 1.2.3.4
but also 1.2.3.4:25. Similarly, ::1 should be encrypted, but also [::1]:25
and ::1#25, as well as fe80::1%eth0. 

Additionally, when stamping out IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in data structures
with checksums (like IP headers), be sure to also update (or zero) those
checksums, as these may provide a weak or even strong indication of the
original IP address.

Protection level that should be accorded to encrypted IP addresses
==================================================================
In general, the more data is stored, the higher should the protection level
be, even with encrypted IP addresses.

As an example, a trace of 100 DNS packets from 100 different IP addresses
does not offer a lot of scope for deanonymization. Hower, a full day
recording of millions of IP addresses should not be shared as if it can't be
deanonymized. 

A lesser risk can already be achieved by encrypting 24 hours of IP
adddresses with 24 different keys, for example.

In general however, should data leak, damage will be significantly less if
IP addresses were encrypted than if they had not been encrypted. 

Another way to look at it is that encrypting IP addresses is always a win,
unless the traces are suddenly shared more widely than before.
